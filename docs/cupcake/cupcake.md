# Cupcake

{: .note}
Cupcake is currently in BETA and is not recommended unless you know are familiar with air-gapped wallets and can self-troubleshoot.
Please do NOT open a support ticket for Cupcake at this time.

Cupcake is an air-gapped wallet using live QR codes.

It works similarly to a hardware wallet, separating the private keys from the main wallet app and becoming a dedicated transaction signer.

Cupcake contains the private wallet keys for transaction signing, whereas Cake Wallet has only the view keys necessary to see balance, transactions, and generate transactions for Cupcake to sign.

## Download

Cupcake can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/eg/app/cupcake-by-cake-wallet/id6737430272){:target="_blank"}, [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cakewallet.cupcake), and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cake-tech/cupcake/releases).

Cupcake is currently only supported on iOS and Android.

## Cryptos

Cupcake currently supports Monero.

More cryptocurrencies will be supported in the future.
