# Exchange support

Cake Wallet supports several third-party exchange integrations for your convenience. We recommend reaching out to the relevant party if you have an issue with their services. Cake Wallet support can help put you in touch with the right team.

## Onramper

We use an [Onramper](https://onramper.com) widget to display these Buy providers. If you have an issue with the widget itself, please contact Cake Wallet support.
