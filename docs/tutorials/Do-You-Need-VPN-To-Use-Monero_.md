## Do You Need a VPN To Use Monero?

[**Monero (XMR)**](https://www.getmonero.org/) is a cryptocurrency that allows for private, untraceable payments. Using a VPN with Monero is not strictly necessary, as XMR transactions are already encrypted and anonymized by default; however, for added security you may want to use a VPN. If you are interested in paying privately for a VPN service, Monero is a good choice. There are several VPN providers that accept XMR as a payment method, such as   [**iVPN**](https://www.ivpn.net/)

**What Does A VPN Do?**
- Hides your traffic from only your Internet Service Provider.
- Hides your downloads (such as torrents) from your ISP and anti-piracy organizations.
- Hides your IP from third-party websites and services, preventing IP based tracking.

You may want to use a VPN to buy Monero for two reasons: **privacy** & **access**. Privacy means that you can hide your IP address and location from the websites or exchanges that sell Monero, as well as from your ISP or government that may monitor your online activity. Access means that you can bypass geo-restrictions or censorship that may prevent you from buying Monero in some countries or regions. A VPN can help you connect to a server in a different location and access the websites or exchanges that accept XMR coin.

**Why You Should Use A VPN**
-   There are 2 connections to worry about: the connection between the wallet and the Monero node, and the Monero node and the rest of the network (a graphic accompanying this would be great)
-   The Monero node to Monero network connection is protected by default with Dandelion++, but it also can be protected by a VPN, Tor, and/or i2p
-   The phone to Monero node connection is not protected by default, but can be with a VPN, Tor, and/or i2p. VPN is the fastest and thus most convenient. Tor/i2p are more decentralized but slow.

Monero is available openly in many exchanges and as a transferable coin in many wallets that can be accessed anywhere easily like inside the [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/) app; technically a VPN is not necessary to utilize the crypto-currency but for many of the reasons why you would want to use Monero, you also would find benefits of using a VPN.

For a the most private and secure wallet for XMR, use Cake Wallet with Linux - Tails OS.
