# Haven

## Syncing

**The most common issue with Haven is an unsynchronized wallet.**

To perform most interactions with your wallet, your wallet must be fully synchronized. There will be a green dot at the top of your home screen.

If you are stuck on the same block while syncing for a while, or it says disconnected, you should [try another node](/docs/advanced-features/custom-node) or another internet connection.

If your wallet is not fully synced, your wallet balance may be incorrect, and you won't be able to send transactions. You will need to wait until your wallet is fully synced before proceeding. Keep the app open with the screen on to keep syncing.

## xAssets

Cake Wallet has full support for the common Haven xAssets like xUSD and the native XHV asset (previously HVN).

You can choose which asset you are sending in the Send screen. Click `Change currency`.

## Auto generate subaddresses

In privacy settings, you can enable or disable the automatic generation of Haven subaddresses. This feature is enabled by default.

When enabled:

* You can still switch between different accounts.
* For each account, it will display in the receive screen the first **unused** subaddress after the last manually labeled or the last used subaddress.
* Your address book will be collapsed to only show one entry per account, which will be linked to the latest subaddress for the relevant account.

You can disable this feature in settings. Doing so will restore the same functionality as before: you will need to manually label and switch to each subaddress.
