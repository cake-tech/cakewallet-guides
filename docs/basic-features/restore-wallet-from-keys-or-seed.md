Then above, paste the seed phrase (or keys), choose the "Seed language", and enter the blockheight from when you created the wallet (if applicable). If you do not know the blockheight, please enter a date from a few days before you created the wallet.

For example, if you created your wallet in Feburary 2020, you could use January 31st, 2020 as the `Restore from date` input. After that, press the `Restore` button and leave your phone awake with the Cake Wallet app open, while your wallet completes synchronization.
