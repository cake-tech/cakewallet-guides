# Create first wallet

We want to welcome you to using Cake Wallet! We hope you have a wonderful experience. If you have any questions, please reach out to our support! :D

## Download the app

You first need the Cake Wallet official application.

* [Apple App Store (iPhone, MacOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cake-wallet-for-xmr-monero/id1334702542)
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cakewallet.cake_wallet&referrer=utm_source%3Dguides.cakewallet.com%26utm_medium%3Dwebsite)
* [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/app/com.cakewallet.cake_wallet)
* [Android APK](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/releases)
* [Linux](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/releases)
* [Windows](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/releases)

## Initial app configuration

### For all devices

Open the wallet application. You will see the option to create your first wallet. Choose only one cryptocurrency type; you can choose additional ones later (see [Create another wallet](/docs/basic-features/create-another-wallet)).

You can choose a manual wallet name, or you can click the right icon to generate a random name. This can't be changed later.

You will be asked to set an access PIN. This stays on your device. You can choose a 4 digit PIN by default, or you can click the text to change to a 6 digit PIN. You can enable biometric authentication later in settings. For Linux, you need to create a password.

## Save your mnemonic seed!

It is ***absolutely imperative*** that you ***save your seed in a safe place***! The most common user error is forgetting to save the seed, resulting in a loss of funds.

You need to save the seed in a safe place. The definition of "safe" depends on your use-case, but it looks like this for most users:

* Put one written copy in a home safe, and another copy in a bank safety deposit box.
* Store the seed in a secure password manager with a ***strong*** password.

If you need to upgrade to a higher security setup later, you can create a new wallet, back up the seed with a high degree of security, and then send your funds to the new wallet.

## Saving seed with password manager

Cake Wallet provides an easy and safe way on wallet creation to save your seed into your password manager if you're using Android or iOS.

Saving your seed to your password manager can be a great way to save your seed, but not all password managers are created equal, some are more secure than others and have had 3rd-party verification on the soundness of the client-side encryption implementation.

Here is a list of a few known-good password managers. Open-source ones are recommended:
