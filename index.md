### Linux installation notes

Cake Wallet runs on most linux devices. We make a compressed folder (tar.gz) and Flatpak available for download. You can also build the wallet using our instructions.

Example operating systems that are known to be working: Tails, Whonix, Ubuntu.

Please note that support is currently a best effort, as the Linux version is still in beta and a user can have hundreds of different Linux system configurations, making it harder to support for installing.

### MacOS installation notes

Cake Wallet is available on both Apple Silicon (eg: M1/M2) and Intel Macs.
